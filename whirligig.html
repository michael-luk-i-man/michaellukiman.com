		A Greyhound Across the Country
	</h1>
	<p>
		When I was around 13 or 14, my mom brought home a book from her library, coming back home from one of her long days as an office clerk in the LAUSD. It was one of those books that was too old for the library to keep - or something like that - an orphan book with tattered spines and paper back. It was almost pocket-size and a bit sepia all around. This book inspired me to do what I'm doing now. It inspired me to travel the world with a light grey curiosity, almost blue, but at the same time green and with flashes of white. The protagonist in Whirligig - he took a Greyhound bus to the corners of the US, building things and learning from everyone he met. Since then, life became not so much an A to B but an optional discourse on life itself. It's a bus trip, at minimum, none so outlandish. Yet what's more, it's the optional abstract and joy of movement in a warm shell across a suitable planet in a singular time. It's a choice and a fairly personal and pleasurable one at that. A Greyhound from New York to California I think is a modest place to begin, just as a fulfillment, home for the holidays, almost.

	<h3>
		Union Square, New York, 12am
	</h3>
	<p>
		I sit in a university hall. I will be sleeping here tonight. It's around empty and I just need to make sure to head to the Greyhound hub by 7:30am. It's Christmas! A perfect start to the journey. I can feel the energy of this place, although I'm underground and about to leave it.

	<h3>
		Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 1pm
	</h3>
	<p>
		This is the capital of Pennsylvania. I have been drifting in and out of sleep Since departing Port Authority. I transferred buses in Philadephia, and this bus is my mainstay.

	<h3>
		Columbus, Ohio, 10pm
	</h3>
	<p>
		I've passed through Sliding Rock, a great big pit stop with a Burger King and Popeyes, of which I stockpiled for both lunch and dinner, respectively reversed. Then I saw myself in Pittsburgh for an impromptu bus change, with some new friends and old friends on the journey. Meme guy has left. He was in a constant state of disinhibition. The Steelers won. I've just read through machine learning slides and finished listening to both Principles by Ray Dalio and The Everything Store read by Pete Larkin, books which tells the stories of Bridgewater and Amazon.

	<p>
		Shake Shack and Denny's start to come into the fold starting here on highway 70.

	<h3>
		To Utah, 1pm
	</h3>
	<p>
		The landscape of extensive snowey hills reminds me of the terrains I used to create in Realmcrafter. The driver is haappy. Chipping at TTP project.

	<h3>
		To Vegas, 3pm 
	</h3>
	<p>
		Bus fan belt broke. Stranded in Utah dependent on Wendy's, Taco Bell, and KFC. At least it's somewhat warm.
