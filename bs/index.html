						<h1>At the Leading Front of Neuroscience: A Bibliometric Study of the 100 Most-Cited Articles</h1>
						<h2>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.<br>Andy Yeung, Tazuko Goto, and W. Leung.<br> 21 July 2017. </h2>
						<p>
							For my first lip-smacking appetizer I'm cutting through the drab and going straight for the meta: an analysis of the 100 most cited neuroscience articles in recorded history.
						</p>
						<p>
							Two of these guys are from University of Hong Kong. They're publishing this review due to "lack of...a comprehensive review of major research topics in neuroscience"<span class="cite tooltip">[1]</span>. They are sure to mention the already published reviews of top articles in subfields of neuroscience, distinguishing those from a more broad evaluation they are attempting. 
						</p>
						<p>
							What's their approach? They gathered data from a service called Web of Science, which provides metrics of published science from 1945 (what a time). Some columns in this data include: publication year, journal impact factor per year, and normalized citation count (defined as first 10 years' citations / count of all neuro publications for those 10 years). 
						</p>
						<p>
							Bradford's law is mentioned as a significant consideration in their measurements. I've met one Bradford in my life and he is a pretty cool guy, so I was curious to see what this other Bradford had to offer. So I looked up the law by itself: Samuel C. Bradford's 1934 "law" estimates how searching for references in science journals has diminishing returns - in other words, most articles a researcher wants to peruse will be in a few journals, similar to the Pareto Principle and Zipf's law. Supposedly, "very rarely" will  researchers need to go outside this set. It leads me to question if this approach is necessarily positive, considering the story of neural net papers that lurked under the radar until computing power became sufficient enough for the method to gain traction (likely more on that in a future reading). Notably, Bradford's law has a three partition prediction that in which the distributions will have ratios 1:n:n^2. In the end, they concluded that citations did not follow Bradford's law. Props for hypothesizing though.
							So, the main point, what were some of the most cited articles in this article? Keep in mind that there were two ranking systems: rank A, which bases off of normalized citation counts, and Rank B, which looks at absolute number of citations. Let's look at Rank A, which implies relative impact per time period to allow more recent contenders to come into the fold.
						</p>
						<p>
							1984's <i>Magnesium gates glutamate-activated channels in mouse central neurons</i> in Nature tops the list, followed by 1988's <i>Glutamate neurotoxicity and diseases of the nervous-system</i> singly authored by D. W. Choi. Some more recent ones (Y2K and after) include <i>Immunobiology of dendritic cells</i>, <i>The 2007 WHO classification of tumours of the central nervous system</i>, <i>Central nervous system control of food intake</i>, <i>An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function</i>, <i>Complex Brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and function systems</i>, <i>Emotion circuits in the brain</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							This list will be a perfect jumping off point for this "paper a day" project, which I will call "Brain States". I'll try to cover the core material and venture into the latest publications both in neuroscience and in the fields of perception, computational learning, and other large breakthroughs.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are surely some gems out there with low citation counts, and I will give them due respect down the line - first training on those at the top, perhaps capturing some trends that inject biased popularity - and thus allowing a complentary eye for any counterintuitive secrets in the woodwork.
						</p>
						<p>
							For now, this record is for my own journaling, whose raw HTML I will upload to Github as a ledger. If you do happen to come across this, thank you for reading the first and most primitive installment of Brain States.

						<h1>Emotion Circuits in the Brain</h1>
						<h2>Annual review of Neuroscience.<br>LeDoux, JE.<br>2000</h2>
						<p>In the top 5 normalized cited neuroscience papers, written by LeDoux of New York University (somewhat my alma mater), this paper isn't afraid to get touchy about the touchy subjects.</p><p>
							We have a cognitive versus emotional fight within this paper, claiming that both need to open their minds a little bit more to a new model.
						</p>
						<p>The limbic system was always associated with emotion, but we can no longer assume so much, with which LeDoux may agree.</p>
						<p>
							Next up we talk a lot about the amygdala and all its projections. It's almost 5AM and I just finished making a cross site request forgery project, but I needed to do the paper for the day. I really liked it and I wish to return to write more about it. I read it during my food shift.

				The approach is simple. At least a paper a day will foster a 365-paper leg up per year. The more papers one reads, the less torturous and intimidating the thickness of scientific jargon becomes, and the more natural and immediate the understanding of the content seems. Additionally, it maintains the integrity and checks the status of the current publishing sphere, which we all know is the best we have, but isn't perfect. It is science from the human perspective patrolled by science in the absolute one. There's no claiming to be an expert in the field regarding every paper read, but we will admit the believe that reading papers that don't necessarily have to do with a PhD area or a silo of a person's specialized field does have its big picture pluses, such as incorporating diverse phenomenon as well as connecting a wider survey on each field's linguistics. At the end of the day, I'm just trying to get a mastery of what we humans have up until this point, so that I can perhaps add on a leaf or two to the home tree.
