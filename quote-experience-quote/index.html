	<div class="frame"><h2>Web Director</h2>
			<div class="sub">Century Radio, October 2016 - May 2017</div>
			<p>Co-leads creating web and administratively curating NYU Shanghai's first and only student-run radio station. "All the interesting people I know have worked in college radio," said Krishan Mistry of NYU Abu Dhabi. Depends on how many people he knows I guess.

			<div class="frame"><h2>Lead Designer &amp; Team Captain</h2>
			<div class="sub">NYU Shanghai Hyperloop Team, September 2015 - February 2016</div>
			<p>Founds team and conducts simulations and computer assisted models for the development of a widely-publicized highspeed transportation system. Invited to present at first official SpaceX Design Weekend, and attended first Hyperloop Pod Race in Hawthorne, California. "Yeah, it was impressive. Hm, the thing might tip over because of that pointy thing," noted SpaceX engineer 1. "Duh, then we'll easily just add another drag force for symmetry", I replied internally. I hear the world's smallest boring machine booting up. Next thing you know that defining point is on the BFR. The team survived.

			<div class="frame"><h2>Vice President</h2>
			<div class="sub">NYU Shanghai Student Government, June 2014 - May 2015</div>
			<p>Represents and organizes undergraduate student body of New York University Shanghai. Serves as 
			liaison between students and faculty. "Democracy", I whispered to my confidante, well-knowing the Shanghai hall may be tapped.

			<div class="frame"><h2>Data Engineer Intern</h2>
			<div class="sub">Specifiko Language Acquistion, Chinaccelerator, March 2015 - May 2015</div>
			<p>Handles data management in the pharmaceutical cross-language program as part of three-man team in one of the largest accelerators in Asia, easing transitions between industry workers in different East Asian countries. "I'm here because I thought we were supposed to do internships in places that genuinely interested us", I thought, naively, "No one told me I should have interned at a bigger corporate tech firm," I mulled, all the way in China, removed from the US college culture, too good-seeking for my own good. <a href="http://specifiko.com">http://specifiko.com</a>

			<div class="frame"><h2>Marketing &amp; Design Intern</h2>
			<div class="sub">Space Global, August 2014 - December 2014</div>
			<p>Assists in research and design in the China to Los Angeles based venture market. Revamped website. "This may be the only opportunity I get to work in real estate," I reasoned as a sophomore.

			<div class="frame"><h2>Co-Founder &amp; Director of Volunteers</h2>
			<div class="sub">HackShanghai, February 2014 - March 2015</div>
			<p>Co-founded HackShanghai as China's largest college hackathon with over 1500 international applicants, raising over $100,000 from 32 sponsor companies with a small multi-disciplinary student team over the course of one year. Main event director of volunteer shifts and roles of dozens of people over 24 hours without sleeping. Successfully made hundreds of participants and 50+ volunteers happy. I guess we also made the school happy. Oh, take me back to those days. Someone better be able to do it again.

			<div class="frame"><h2>Founder and Representative</h2>
			<div class="sub">NYU Shanghai Entrepreneurship Organization, August 2013 - Present</div>
			<p>Facilitates student collaboration following the creation of NYU Shanghai's entrepreneurship club. I started the club and ran events because I liked startups. I wanted to meet people who also did. I did. Neat beans. If you ever need internal Shanghai contacts for consumer markets, hit me up.
